Critics\r\nClarity:\r\nInconsistent time period\r\nLike the chart of Japan which only provided the data during 2020 less than other chart.it could decrease of the persuasion of data.\r\nInconsistent unit f axis\r\nThere are two axises in one chart which present the value with same nature ,the difference could mislead the understanding of the viewers\r\nLack of unit of measurement\r\nIt doesn’t show how value the trade which cannot supportive to explain the data\r\nLack of commentary and necessary annotation\r\nIt makes viewer take more time to understand the data\r\nBroad title\r\nDo not tell the main point of the data\r\nAesthetics:\r\nChart details\r\nUnsuitable size of the title\r\nThe subtitle of each chart is bigger than the total title make reader hard to notice the main title\r\nUnsuitable type of chart\r\nAs the discrete type of data, it more suitable be presented in bar chart\r\nUnaligned chart\r\n3. Proposed Design\r\n3.1 Sketch\r\n\r\n3.2 Advantages of Proposed Design\r\nClear title – shows the main story the data tells make reader understand easily\r\nAdd concise commentary to support the commentary\r\nWith the consist unit to make data comparable among the top6 regions\r\nConsistent color through the whole dashboard\r\nEnrich the data story by provide a overview of the data topic\r\nShow clearly about the difference between import and export\r\nAdd necessary annotation to stress the importance information\r\n4. Data Visualisation Steps\r\n4.1 Preparation of data\r\nDelete the unnecessary data by excel—useless old data\r\nBy excel function with offset, transform and selection to select the desired data\r\nExport the managed data to a new file named “managed data.excl”\r\n4.2 Visualization of data\r\nImport the new data file into the tableau\r\nChange the data type—column “date” to data type\r\n4.2.1 Overview tab\r\nImport relative data\r\nDrag [Merchandised Import] and [Merchandised Export] to Rows and drag [Day] to Columns.\r\n\r\nApply Filter\r\nDrag [Merchandized Export] to Filters panel\r\n\r\nApply color\r\n\r\nEdit axis\r\nMake the two range of the axis are same and rename the axis to export and import to clearly presented.\r\n\r\nShade the axis color to match the chart color\r\n\r\nAdd title and commentary\r\n\r\nThe final results\r\n\r\n4.2.2 Top Regions Tab\r\nImport relative data\r\nDrag [Merchandised Import] and [Merchandized Export] to Rows and Columns respectively\r\n\r\nAdd new calculated filed\r\nNamed total value which equals :[ total merchandised import] add [total merchandised export]\r\n\r\nDrag the [Total value] to size, drag the [Region/Markets] to color.\r\n\r\nGroup the top6 regions and color them to differentiate with others.\r\n\r\nAdd annotation to stress the information\r\n\r\nAdd the title and commentary\r\n * Add the title and commentary\r\n\r\nThe final results\r\n\r\n4.2.3 Top Region Monthly Distribution Tab\r\nImport relative data\r\nDrag [Merchandized Import], [Merchandized Export] and [Region/Markets] to Rows and drag [Date] to Columns\r\n\r\nEdit the axis\r\nMake the axis to reverse, fixe the axis range and rename the axis\r\n\r\nSort the display by region\r\n\r\nColor the chart in terms of the year periods\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd the title and commentary\r\n\r\nThe final results\r\n\r\n4.2.4 Dashboard\r\nSelect size - automatic\r\nDrag the charts and make layout to show appropriatly\r\nAdd source\r\nUsing Objects > Text > drag to bottom and add data source and notices\r\nAdd author\r\nAdd text to bottom left corner and add text : “DataViz Makeover #1 by HUANG SHAN (shan.huang.2020@mitb.smu.edu.sg) align left\r\nThe final results\r\n\r\n5. Main Observations\r\nAlthough the amount value of trade shown volatility during the period from 2019.01 to 2021.01, the Singapore still keep a relatively stable trade surplus, especially, in the current year, the amount trade has increased compared with the pass time\r\nThe major trade partners in Singapore divided into two groups, one is the big region which has large consumer power or producer ability, another one is the neighbor countries which have close distance and low cost (like transportation cost.etc)\r\nCompared with the trade value distribution among the top6 regions, it obviously tells that the top 3 regions which have large population show relatively higher demand both in import and export, while the other 3 regions with small areas and population, could always show the imbalance in the two converse direction trade,like Taiwan is an important supplier for Singapore while it doesn’t heavily dependent on Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nIn this article, we will show you how to plot a figure with multiple histograms by using ggplot2 and ggpubr packages.\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\n\r\nTo insert a graph.\r\n\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch ggpubr and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\nR code\r\npackages = c(‘ggpubr’, ‘tidyverse’)\r\nfor(p in packages){library if(!require(p, character.only = T)){ install.packages(p) } library(p, character.only = T) }\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\nR code\r\nwine <- read_csv(“data/wine_quality.csv”)\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted by using ggplot() and geom_histogram() of ggplot2 package. Then, ggarrange() of ggpubr package is used to patch these histogram into a single figure to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\nRcode\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= fixed acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) va <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= volatile acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= citric acid)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) rs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= residual sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) fSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= free sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) tSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= total sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) density <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) pH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) sulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) alcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”)\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
