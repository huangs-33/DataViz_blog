Main Observations\r\nMainland China is the most major trade partner based on the total trade value which almost US $136.2m thousand in 2020, referring to the past trade performance, since 2011, Singapore maintained a trade surplus with China, but the trade surplus fluctuated. In 2018, Singapore’s trade surplus with China was only US $1 million thousand, a significant decrease compared with the same period last year.\r\n\r\nAmerica as a major trade partner, since 2011, the value of export was still increasing while the import value shown fluctuation which during 2011-2016 in a descend trend, during 2016-2018 in a ascend trend, since 2019, the value of import began decreased and completely became a net exporter in 2020 with a trade surplus of US $5.3m thousand. One of the reason may be the COVID19, serious situation in US push the demand increased.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, Taiwan is the No.1 net importer with the largest trade surplus of US $24m thousand while the HK is the No.1 net exporter with highest trade deficit of US $58.5m thousand. Both as part of China and similar relative small regions, the difference in trade performance may due to the different main industries, HK as a financial center, the third industry is the biggest contributor to economic output, while Taiwan has abundant resource could meet the local demand and import products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\nR code\r\nwine <- read_csv(“data/wine_quality.csv”)\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted by using ggplot() and geom_histogram() of ggplot2 package. Then, ggarrange() of ggpubr package is used to patch these histogram into a single figure to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\nRcode\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= fixed acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) va <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= volatile acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= citric acid)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) rs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= residual sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) fSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= free sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) tSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= total sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) density <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) pH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) sulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) alcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”)\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
